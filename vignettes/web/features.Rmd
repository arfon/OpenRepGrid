This page gives an overview over the features currently implemented in the OpenRepGrid R package. Note that the most accurate list of features in always found in the documentation of the R package itself. We try to keep this list up-to-date though. 

As the package development is an ongoing process there might be forms of analysis that have not yet been implemented. If you miss any features please [make a suggestion](../../CONTRIBUTING.html) for a new feature or for an enhancement or modification of an old features here.
