# TODOs

  * switch to cli package for console output?
  * make some function generic so they accept repgridlists as well (index functions)
  * Format scripts with RStudio comment headers to make them more readable
  * Redo printing wherever necessary
  * replace print funs in constructCor etc. with print_square_matrix 
  * move gh-pages to /docs folder
  * add tests
  * biplot with others in one function (see email Jos√©)
  * intensity for elements does not yet match
  * add tests for reorder
  * build bipolar variant of construct matches? (similar to IC)
