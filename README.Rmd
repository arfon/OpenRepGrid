## About

**OpenRepGrid** is an R package to analyze and visualize [repertory grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid)  data. The repertory grid (often abbreviated *grid* or *repgrid*) is a data collection method which originated from *Personal Construct Theory (PCT)* [@kelly_psychology_1955]. It was originally designed as an instrument for psychotherapy to shed light on a client’s construction of the world. Over subsequent decades, the technique has been adopted in many other fields, including market, organizational, political, educational and sensory research [@fransella_manual_2004]. 

The data the RGT generates is *qualitative* and *quantitative*. On the qualitative side, the technique elicits the repertory of bipolar attributes (e.g. *smart vs. dull*, so called *constructs* in PCT terminology) an individual uses to make distinctions between entities of the world (e.g. different people, so called *elements* in PCT terminolgy). On the quatitative side, it requires rating each element on each elicited personal construct (e.g. *Martin* gets a score of 2 on the *quarrelsome = 1 vs. peaceful = 6* construct, indicating that Martin is quite quarrelsome). The result of the data collection procedure is a data matrix. The constructs are usually presented as matrix rows, the elements as columns and each cell contains the corresponding rating score. Figure 1 depicts a repertory grid data set, with the rows (constructs) and columns (elements) being clustered by similarity (see below for details). A thorough introduction to the repertory grid technique is given by @fransella_manual_2004.
